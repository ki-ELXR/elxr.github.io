I traveled with my family to Spain in late 2024 and I was enamored with the art and architecture. More than the Christian/Catholic motifs which emphasized tangible humans and figures of Christ I was particularly interested in the Islamic designs which were subtle, and abstract.  There was a kind of mathematical elegance to them, with a simple base but extrapolated with complexity.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
